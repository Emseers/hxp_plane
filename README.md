# hxp_plane
Trying to do a damn plane in HaxePunk.

Similar to the old flash game [Skies of War]
(http://www.hagserver.com/swfo/83-skies-of-war-extended.swf?version=1359034493)

###build:

1) Get [Haxe](http://haxe.org/download)

2) Install haxepunk:

	haxelib install HaxePunk
	haxelib run HaxePunk setup

3) Get lime to support OSs:

	lime setup windows
	lime setup linux

4) Set lime to last working Windows version:

	haxelib set lime 2.4.3

	
5) (Optional) Get [FlashDevelop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/community/viewforum.php?f=11),
works really well for Haxe and Flash work

Clone and open project in FD, should work.
